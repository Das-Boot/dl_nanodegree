# Deep Learning Nanodegree Project

## Inroduction

Collection of python DL projects created for Udacity DL Nanodegree course. 
It consists of five projects and their corresponding review.

## Projects

### First Neural Network 

Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.

### Image classification

Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.

### Text Generation 

Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.

### Machine Translation

Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)

### Face Generation 

Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.

## Contribution
TODO and Implement parts in the notebook done by Zhaoning Li. Document strcure done by Udacity Team.
